# Hikari IDS

## About:
Hikari-IDS was my final year BSc (hons) project to investigate the use of quantized, clustered and pruned Multi Layer Perceptrons as a lightweight approach to anomaly based intrusion detection in IoT networks. Configurations of 1 or 2 hidden layers with 25, 50, 75, 125, 150, 175 neurons each and the use of the ReLu or Sigmoid activation functions were evaluated over the validation set to select a baseline underlying model architecture. The final architecture selected for evaluation of each optimisation technique over the test set on the basis of highest F-Score obtained had two hidden layers with 150 neurons each and the use of the ReLu activation function.
